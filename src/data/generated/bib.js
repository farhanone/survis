        "abstract": "Searching topological similarity between a pair of shapes or data is an important problem in data analysis and visualization. The problem of computing similarity measures using scalar topology has been studied extensively and proven useful in shape and data matching. Even though multi-field (or multivariate) topology-based techniques reveal richer topological features, research on computing similarity measures using multi-field topology is still in its infancy. In the current paper, we propose a novel similarity measure between two piecewise-linear multi-fields based on their multi-resolution Reeb spaces - a newly developed data-structure that captures the topology of a multi-field. Overall, our method consists of two steps: (i) building a multi-resolution Reeb space corresponding to each of the multi-fields and (ii) proposing a similarity measure for a list of matching pairs (of nodes), obtained by comparing the multi-resolution Reeb spaces. We demonstrate an application of the proposed similarity measure by detecting the nuclear scission point in a time-varying multi-field data from computational physics",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the design and features of a visualization tool, called ParaViewi, a tool for scientists to visualize and analysis extremely large data sets. The tool provides a graphical user interface for the creation and dynamic execution of visualization tasks. ParaView transparently supports the visualization and rendering of large data sets by executing these programs in parallel on shared or distributed memory machines. ParaView supports hardware-accelerated parallel rendering and achieves interactive rendering performance via level-of-detail techniques. The design balances and integrates a number of diverse requirements including the ability to handle large data, ease of use and extensibility by developers. This paper describes the requirements that guided the design, identifies their importance to scientific users, and discusses key design decision and tradeoffs.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents topology-based methods to robustly extract, analyze, and track features defined as subsets of isosurfaces. First, we demonstrate how features identified by thresholding isosurfaces can be defined in terms of the Morse complex. Second, we present a specialized hierarchy that encodes the feature segmentation independent of the threshold while still providing a flexible multiresolution representation. Third, for a given parameter selection, we create detailed tracking graphs representing the complete evolution of all features in a combustion simulation over several hundred time steps. Finally, we discuss a user interface that correlates the tracking information with interactive rendering of the segmented isosurfaces enabling an in-depth analysis of the temporal behavior. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing three numerical simulations of lean hydrogen flames subject to different levels of turbulence. Due to their unstable nature, lean flames burn in cells separated by locally extinguished regions. The number, area, and evolution over time of these cells provide important insights into the impact of turbulence on the combustion process. Utilizing the hierarchy, we can perform an extensive parameter study without reprocessing the data for each set of parameters. The resulting statistics enable scientists to select appropriate parameters and provide insight into the sensitivity of the results with respect to the choice of parameters. Our method allows for the first time to quantitatively correlate the turbulence of the burning process with the distribution of burning regions, properly segmented and selected. In particular, our analysis shows that counterintuitively stronger turbulence leads to larger cell structures, which burn more intensely than expected. This behavior suggests that flames could be stabilized under much leaner conditions than previously anticipated.",

The persistence landscape is a topological summary that can be easily combined with tools from statistics and machine learning. We give efficient algorithms for calculating persistence landscapes, their averages, and distances between such averages. We discuss an implementation of these algorithms and some related procedures. These are intended to facilitate the combination of statistics and machine learning with topological data analysis. We present an experiment showing that the low-dimensional persistence landscapes of points sampled from spheres (and boxes) of varying dimensions differ. ",

This invariant is a multiset of intervals that denote the lifetimes of the topological entities within the filtration. In many applications of topology, we need to study a multifiltration: a family of spaces parameterized along multiple geometric dimensions. In this paper, we show that no similar complete discrete invariant exists for multidimensional persistence. Instead, we propose the rank invariant, a discrete invariant for the robust estimation of Betti numbers in a multifiltration, and prove its completeness in one dimension.",

        "abstract": "Persistence diagrams (PDs) play a key role in topological data analysis (TDA), in which they are routinely used to describe topological properties of complicated shapes. PDs enjoy strong stability properties and have proven their utility in various learning contexts. They do not, however, live in a space naturally endowed with a Hilbert structure and are usually compared with specific distances, such as the bottleneck distance. To incorporate PDs in a learning pipeline, several kernels have been proposed for PDs with a strong emphasis on the stability of the RKHS distance w.r.t. perturbations of the PDs. In this article, we use the Sliced Wasserstein approximation SW of the Wasserstein distance to define a new kernel for PDs, which is not only provably stable but also provably discriminative (depending on the number of points in the PDs) w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance {\\$}d{\\_}1{\\$} between PDs. We also demonstrate its practicality, by developing an approximation technique to reduce kernel computation time, and show that our proposal compares favorably to existing kernels for PDs on several benchmarks.",

Methods introduced in previous years were usually evaluated separately or rather informally. However, to aid the decision which method is best suited for a particular kind of data, it is important to compare and put them into context with each other. Using results from optimization mathematics, this paper finds subset and equivalence relations between Jacobi Sets and Pareto Sets and indicates even further relations to Morse decomposition. This is a first step towards the creation of new analysis tools for multifield topology and of new insight about how the topological approaches are connected with each other.",

In this paper we propose a definition for such structures using the concepts of Pareto optimality and Pareto dominance. Given a set of piecewise-linear, scalar functions over a common simplical complex of any dimension, our method finds regions of ``consensus'' among single fields critical points and their connectivity relations. We show that our concepts are useful to data analysis on real-world examples originating from fluid-flow simulations; in two cases where the consensus of multiple scalar vortex predictors is of interest and in another case where one predictor is studied under different simulation parameters. We also compare the properties of our approach with current alternatives.",

Considering the magnitude of this field, minima represent characteristic structures of the flow that can be classified as saddle- or vortex-like. We made the interesting observation that vortex-like minima are enclosed by particularly pronounced ridges. This makes it possible to define boundaries of vortex regions in a parameter-free way. Utilizing scalar field topology, a robust algorithm can be designed to extract such boundaries. They can be arbitrarily shaped. An efficient tracking algorithm allows us to display the temporal evolution of vortices. Various vortex models are used to evaluate the method. We apply our method to two-dimensional model systems from computational fluid dynamics and compare the results to those arising from existing definitions.",

The analysis tool provides common plots as scatter plots and parallel coordinates to explore the correlation of different quantities. An abstract representation of the vortex merge graph highlights birth, death and merges of vortices. Interactive picking of substructures supports a closer insepection of single vortices and their evolution. A further step inte- grates the regions of influence into the statistical analysis.

Each source provides an additional perspective on the phenomenon of interest, but also comes with specific limitations, e.g. regarding accuracy, spatial and temporal availability. Effectively combining and analyzing such multimodal and partially incomplete data of limited accuracy in an integrated way is challenging. In this work, we outline an approach for an integrated analysis and visualization of the atmospheric impact of volcano eruptions. The data sets comprise observation and imaging data from satellites as well as results from numerical particle simulations. To analyze the clouds from the volcano eruption in the spatiotemporal domain we apply topological methods. Extremal structures reveal structures in the data that support clustering and comparison. We further discuss the robustness of those methods with respect to different properties of the data and different parameter setups. Finally we outline open challenges for the effective integrated visualization using topological methods.",

In this field, persistence diagrams are widely used as a descriptor of the input data, and can distinguish robust and noisy topological properties. Nowadays, it is highly desired to develop a statistical framework on persistence diagrams to deal with practical data. This paper proposes a kernel method on persistence diagrams. A theoretical contribution of our method is that the proposed kernel allows one to control the effect of persistence, and, if necessary, noisy topological properties can be discounted in data analysis. Furthermore, the method provides a fast approximation technique.

        "abstract": "Algebraic topology methods have recently played an important role for statistical analysis with complicated geometric structured data such as shapes, linked twist maps, and material data. Among them, $\\backslash$textit{\\{}persistent homology{\\}} is a well-known tool to extract robust topological features, and outputs as $\\backslash$textit{\\{}persistence diagrams{\\}} (PDs). However, PDs are point multi-sets which can not be used in machine learning algorithms for vector data. To deal with it, an emerged approach is to use kernel methods, and an appropriate geometry for PDs is an important factor to measure the similarity of PDs. A popular geometry for PDs is the $\\backslash$textit{\\{}Wasserstein metric{\\}}. However, Wasserstein distance is not $\\backslash$textit{\\{}negative definite{\\}}. Thus, it is limited to build positive definite kernels upon the Wasserstein distance $\\backslash$textit{\\{}without approximation{\\}}. In this work, we rely upon the alternative $\\backslash$textit{\\{}Fisher information geometry{\\}} to propose a positive definite kernel for PDs $\\backslash$textit{\\{}without approximation{\\}}, namely the Persistence Fisher (PF) kernel. Then, we analyze eigensystem of the integral operator induced by the proposed kernel for kernel machines. Based on that, we derive generalization error bounds via covering numbers and Rademacher averages for kernel machines with the PF kernel. Additionally, we show some nice properties such as stability and infinite divisibility for the proposed kernel. Furthermore, we also propose a linear time complexity over the number of points in PDs for an approximation of our proposed kernel with a bounded error. Throughout experiments with many different tasks on various benchmark datasets, we illustrate that the PF kernel compares favorably with other baseline kernels for PDs.",

They either are not deterministic due to using Monte Carlo approaches, approximate the data with confidence intervals, or miss out on incorporating important properties, such as correlation. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of critical points of Gaussian- distributed scalar fields. We introduce methods to deterministically extract critical points, approximate their probability with high precision, and even capture relations between them resulting in an abstract graph representation. Unlike many other methods, we incorporate all information contained in the data including global correlation. Our work therefore is a first step towards a reliable and complete description of topological features of Gaussian-distributed scalar fields.",

        "abstract": "We present a new technique called ``t-SNE'' that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.",

In this paper, we focus on one such metric, the $\\ell^\\infty$-cophenetic metric introduced by Cardona et al. This metric works by representing a phylogenetic tree with $n$ labeled leaves as a point in  $\\mathbb{R}^{n(n+1)/2}$  known as the cophenetic vector, then comparing the two resulting Euclidean points using the $\\ell^\\infty$ distance. Meanwhile, the interleaving distance is a formal categorical construction generalized from the definition of Chazal et al., originally introduced to compare persistence modules arising from the field of topological data analysis. We show that the $\\ell^\\infty$-cophenetic metric is an example of an interleaving distance. To do this, we define phylogenetic trees as a category of merge trees with some additional structure, namely, labelings on the leaves plus a requirement that morphisms respect these labels. Then we can use the definition of a flow on this category to give an interleaving distance. Finally, we show that, because of the additional structure given by the categories defined, the map sending a labeled merge tree to the cophenetic vector is, in fact, an isometric embedding, thus proving that the $\\ell^\\infty$-cophenetic metric is an interleaving dis",

        "abstract": "Cyclones are a weather phenomenon which is still actively researched today, since their complex nature make them hard to predict, track and visualize. Facilitating easy-to-use, interactive exploration and analysis of cyclones can serve as a useful tool to support domain scientists in their research. We present a framework for tracking and visualizing multi- center cyclones, which takes into account cyclones which merge and split over their lifetime. All parts of our framework allow interaction by domain scientists: the algorithm for computing the tracking graph, selections of individual cyclone tracks and the parameters used for visualizing the results. A cyclonic region defines the spread and boundary of a cyclone and over time, the pressure within the region changes. Therefore, a cyclone cannot be represented by an iso-surface in three dimensions and instead, we segment a volume by region growing from the track of the cyclone and finally, extracting a surface around the cyclonic region. We offer multiple criteria for this algorithm, allowing the domain scientist to explore and visually analyze the data. Furthermore, we enable an easy overview of the cyclone time series by mapping time to the third dimension.",

Very large data sets must be processed, consisting of multivariate data at large numbers of grid points, often arranged in many time steps. Recently, the steadily increasing performance of computers again has become a driving force for new advances in flow visualization, especially in techniques based on texturing, feature extraction, vector field clustering, and topology extraction. In this article we present the state of the art in feature-based flow visualization techniques. We will present numerous feature extraction techniques, categorized according to the type of feature. Next, feature tracking and event detection algorithms are discussed, for studying the evolution of features in time-dependent data sets. Finally, various visualization techniques are demonstrated.",

Most pre- vious work has focused on analyzing changes in co-fluctuations between a set of brain regions over several temporal segments of the data. We argue that by collapsing data in space or time, we stand to lose useful information about the brain's dynamical organization. Here we use Topological Data Analysis to reveal the overall organization of whole-brain activity maps at a single-participant level---as an interactive representation---without arbitrarily collapsing data in space or time. Using existing multitask fMRI datasets, with the known ground truth about the timing of transitions from one task-block to next, our approach tracks both within- and between-task transitions at a much faster time scale (~4--9 s) than before. The individual differences in the revealed dynamical organization predict task performance. In summary, our approach distills complex brain dynamics into interactive and behaviorally relevant representations.",

        "abstract": "Understanding fluid flow data, especially vortices, is still a challenging task. Sophisticated visualization tools help to gain insight. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the interactive comparison of scalar fields using isosurfaces, and its application to fluid flow datasets. Features in two scalar fields are defined by largest contour segmentation after topological simplification. These features are matched using a volumetric similarity measure based on spatial overlap of individual features. The relationships defined by this similarity measure are ranked and presented in a thumbnail gallery of feature pairs and a graph representation showing all relationships between individual contours. Additionally, linked views of the contour trees are provided to ease navigation. The main render view shows the selected features overlapping each other. Thus, by displaying individual features and their relationships in a structured fashion, we enable exploratory visualization of correlations between similar structures in two scalar fields. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a number of complex fluid flow datasets, where the emphasis is put on the comparison of vortex related scalar quantities.",

        "abstract": "Tracking the temporal evolution of features in time-varying data remains a combinatorially challenging problem. A recent method models event detection as a maximum-weight independent set problem on a graph representation of all possible explanations [35]. However, optimally solving this problem is NP-hard in the general case. Following the approach by Schnorr et al., we propose a new algorithm for event detection. Our algorithm exploits the modelspecific structure of the independent set problem. Specifically, we show how to traverse potential explanations in such a way that a greedy assignment provides reliably good results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic and simulation data sets, the former of which include ground-truth tracking information which enable a quantitative evaluation. Our results are within 1 of the theoretical optimum and comparable to an approximate solution provided by a state-of-the-art optimization package. At the same time, our algorithm is significantly faster.",

In this paper, we extend the benefits of the contour tree to time-varying data visualization. We define temporal correspondence of contour components and describe an algorithm to compute the correspondence information in time-dependent contour trees. A graph representing the topology changes of time-varying isosurfaces is constructed in real-time for any selected isovalue using the precomputed correspondence information. Quantitative properties, such as surface area and volume of contour components, are computed and labeled on the graph. This topology change graph helps users to detect significant topological and geometric changes in time-varying isosurfaces. The graph is also used as an interactive user interface to segment, track, and visualize the evolution of any selected contour components over time",

        "abstract": "Feature Flow Fields are a well-accepted approach for extracting and tracking features. In particular, they are often used to track critical points in time-dependent vector fields and to extract and track vortex core lines. The general idea is to extract the feature or its temporal evolution using a stream line integration in a derived vector field -- the so-called Feature Flow Field (FFF). Hence, the desired feature line is a stream line of the FFF. As we will carefully analyze in this paper, the stream lines around this feature line may diverge from it. This creates an unstable situation: if the integration moves slightly off the feature line due to numerical errors, then it will be captured by the diverging neighborhood and carried away from the real feature line. The goal of this paper is to define a new FFF with the guarantee that the neighborhood of a feature line has always converging behavior. This way, we have an automatic correction of numerical errors: if the integration moves slightly off the feature line, it automatically moves back to it during the ongoing integration. This yields results which are an order of magnitude more accurate than the results from previous schemes. We present new stable FFF formulations for the main applications of tracking critical points and solving the Parallel Vectors operator. We apply our method to a number of data sets.",

A dual contour tree structure is constructed from the contour tree of a volume by dividing its functional range into segments such that the connected contour tree edges within a segment become a node in the dual tree. Each node of the dual contour tree corresponds to a connected sub-volume bounded by contours within a certain range segment. Attributes such as functional range, volume, and Betti number of bounding contours are further computed for each node of the dual contour tree. A similarity metric between two volumes is computed by matching the multi-resolution dual contour trees and corresponding attributes. When applied to biomolecular structures and associated properties such as electrostatic potentials, this al-gorithm shows good performance separating proteins into different classes.",
