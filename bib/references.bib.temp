	abstract = {Abstract Topological data analysis provides a multiscale description of the geometry and topology of quantitative data. The persistence landscape is a topological summary that can be easily combined with tools from statistics and machine learning. We give efficient algorithms for calculating persistence landscapes, their averages, and distances between such averages. We discuss an implementation of these algorithms and some related procedures. These are intended to facilitate the combination of statistics and machine learning with topological data analysis. We present an experiment showing that the low-dimensional persistence landscapes of points sampled from spheres (and boxes) of varying dimensions differ. },

	abstract = {How can the notion of topological structures for single scalar fields
	be extended to multifields? In this paper we propose a definition
	for such structures using the concepts of Pareto optimality and Pareto
	dominance. Given a set of piecewise-linear, scalar functions over
	a common simplical complex of any dimension, our method finds regions
	of ``consensus'' among single fields critical points and their connectivity
	relations. We show that our concepts are useful to data analysis
	on real-world examples originating from fluid-flow simulations; in
	two cases where the consensus of multiple scalar vortex predictors
	is of interest and in another case where one predictor is studied
	under different simulation parameters. We also compare the properties
	of our approach with current alternatives.},

@article{Weinkauf2010,
	abstract = {Feature Flow Fields are a well-accepted approach for extracting and
	tracking features. In particular, they are often used to track critical
	points in time-dependent vector fields and to extract and track vortex
	core lines. The general idea is to extract the feature or its temporal
	evolution using a stream line integration in a derived vector field
	-- the so-called Feature Flow Field (FFF). Hence, the desired feature
	line is a stream line of the FFF. As we will carefully analyze in
	this paper, the stream lines around this feature line may diverge
	from it. This creates an unstable situation: if the integration moves
	slightly off the feature line due to numerical errors, then it will
	be captured by the diverging neighborhood and carried away from the
	real feature line. The goal of this paper is to define a new FFF
	with the guarantee that the neighborhood of a feature line has always
	converging behavior. This way, we have an automatic correction of
	numerical errors: if the integration moves slightly off the feature
	line, it automatically moves back to it during the ongoing integration.
	This yields results which are an order of magnitude more accurate
	than the results from previous schemes. We present new stable FFF
	formulations for the main applications of tracking critical points
	and solving the Parallel Vectors operator. We apply our method to
	a number of data sets.},

	abstract = {Topological data analysis is an emerging mathematical concept for characterizing shapes in multi-scale data. In this field, persistence diagrams are widely used as a descriptor of the input data, and can distinguish robust and noisy topological properties. Nowadays, it is highly desired to develop a statistical framework on persistence diagrams to deal with practical data. This paper proposes a kernel method on persistence diagrams. A theoretical contribution of our method is that the proposed kernel allows one to control the effect of persistence, and, if necessary, noisy topological properties can be discounted in data analysis. Furthermore, the method provides a fast approximation technique. The method is applied into several problems including practical data in physics, and the results show the advantage compared to the existing kernel method on persistence diagrams.},

@article{LeYamada2018,
	abstract = {Algebraic topology methods have recently played an important role for statistical analysis with complicated geometric structured data such as shapes, linked twist maps, and material data. Among them, $\backslash$textit{\{}persistent homology{\}} is a well-known tool to extract robust topological features, and outputs as $\backslash$textit{\{}persistence diagrams{\}} (PDs). However, PDs are point multi-sets which can not be used in machine learning algorithms for vector data. To deal with it, an emerged approach is to use kernel methods, and an appropriate geometry for PDs is an important factor to measure the similarity of PDs. A popular geometry for PDs is the $\backslash$textit{\{}Wasserstein metric{\}}. However, Wasserstein distance is not $\backslash$textit{\{}negative definite{\}}. Thus, it is limited to build positive definite kernels upon the Wasserstein distance $\backslash$textit{\{}without approximation{\}}. In this work, we rely upon the alternative $\backslash$textit{\{}Fisher information geometry{\}} to propose a positive definite kernel for PDs $\backslash$textit{\{}without approximation{\}}, namely the Persistence Fisher (PF) kernel. Then, we analyze eigensystem of the integral operator induced by the proposed kernel for kernel machines. Based on that, we derive generalization error bounds via covering numbers and Rademacher averages for kernel machines with the PF kernel. Additionally, we show some nice properties such as stability and infinite divisibility for the proposed kernel. Furthermore, we also propose a linear time complexity over the number of points in PDs for an approximation of our proposed kernel with a bounded error. Throughout experiments with many different tasks on various benchmark datasets, we illustrate that the PF kernel compares favorably with other baseline kernels for PDs.},

	abstract = {Persistence diagrams (PDs) play a key role in topological data analysis (TDA), in which they are routinely used to describe topological properties of complicated shapes. PDs enjoy strong stability properties and have proven their utility in various learning contexts. They do not, however, live in a space naturally endowed with a Hilbert structure and are usually compared with specific distances, such as the bottleneck distance. To incorporate PDs in a learning pipeline, several kernels have been proposed for PDs with a strong emphasis on the stability of the RKHS distance w.r.t. perturbations of the PDs. In this article, we use the Sliced Wasserstein approximation SW of the Wasserstein distance to define a new kernel for PDs, which is not only provably stable but also provably discriminative (depending on the number of points in the PDs) w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance {\$}d{\_}1{\$} between PDs. We also demonstrate its practicality, by developing an approximation technique to reduce kernel computation time, and show that our proposal compares favorably to existing kernels for PDs on several benchmarks.},

	abstract = {There are many metrics available to compare phylogenetic trees since this is a fundamental task in computational biology. In this paper, we focus on one such metric, the $\ell^\infty$-cophenetic metric introduced by Cardona et al. This metric works by representing a phylogenetic tree with $n$ labeled leaves as a point in  $\mathbb{R}^{n(n+1)/2}$  known as the cophenetic vector, then comparing the two resulting Euclidean points using the $\ell^\infty$ distance. Meanwhile, the interleaving distance is a formal categorical construction generalized from the definition of Chazal et al., originally introduced to compare persistence modules arising from the field of topological data analysis. We show that the $\ell^\infty$-cophenetic metric is an example of an interleaving distance. To do this, we define phylogenetic trees as a category of merge trees with some additional structure, namely, labelings on the leaves plus a requirement that morphisms respect these labels. Then we can use the definition of a flow on this category to give an interleaving distance. Finally, we show that, because of the additional structure given by the categories defined, the map sending a labeled merge tree to the cophenetic vector is, in fact, an isometric embedding, thus proving that the $\ell^\infty$-cophenetic metric is an interleaving dis},

	abstract = {This paper presents topology-based methods to robustly extract, analyze, and track features defined as subsets of isosurfaces. First, we demonstrate how features identified by thresholding isosurfaces can be defined in terms of the Morse complex. Second, we present a specialized hierarchy that encodes the feature segmentation independent of the threshold while still providing a flexible multiresolution representation. Third, for a given parameter selection, we create detailed tracking graphs representing the complete evolution of all features in a combustion simulation over several hundred time steps. Finally, we discuss a user interface that correlates the tracking information with interactive rendering of the segmented isosurfaces enabling an in-depth analysis of the temporal behavior. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing three numerical simulations of lean hydrogen flames subject to different levels of turbulence. Due to their unstable nature, lean flames burn in cells separated by locally extinguished regions. The number, area, and evolution over time of these cells provide important insights into the impact of turbulence on the combustion process. Utilizing the hierarchy, we can perform an extensive parameter study without reprocessing the data for each set of parameters. The resulting statistics enable scientists to select appropriate parameters and provide insight into the sensitivity of the results with respect to the choice of parameters. Our method allows for the first time to quantitatively correlate the turbulence of the burning process with the distribution of burning regions, properly segmented and selected. In particular, our analysis shows that counterintuitively stronger turbulence leads to larger cell structures, which burn more intensely than expected. This behavior suggests that flames could be stabilized under much leaner conditions than previously anticipated.},

The analysis typically requires a mathematically sound definition of the features of interest and robust algorithms to identify these features, compute statistics about them, and often track them over time. Because scientific datasets often capture phenomena with multi-scale behaviour, and almost always contain noise the definitions and algorithms must be designed with sufficient flexibility and care to allow multi-scale analysis and noise-removal. In this paper, we present some recent work on topological feature extraction and tracking with applications in molecular analysis, combustion simulation, and structural analysis of porous materials.},

More recently, it has been used in various applications to study noisy data which creates a desire to define a measure of similarity between these structures. Here, we exploit the fact that the category of Reeb graphs is equivalent to the category of a particular class of cosheaf. Using this equivalency, we can define an `interleaving' distance between Reeb graphs which is stable under the perturbation of a function. Along the way, we obtain a natural construction for smoothing a Reeb graph to reduce its topological complexity. The smoothed Reeb graph can be constructed in polynomial time.},

@article{CarriereOudot2017b,
	abstract = {As graphical summaries for topological spaces and maps, Reeb graphs are common objects in the computer graphics or topological data analysis literature. Defining good metrics between these objects has become an important question for applications, where it matters to quantify the extent by which two given Reeb graphs differ. Recent contributions emphasize this aspect, proposing novel distances such as {\em functional distortion} or {\em interleaving} that are provably more discriminative than the so-called {\em bottleneck distance}, being true metrics whereas the latter is only a pseudo-metric. Their main drawback compared to the bottleneck distance is to be comparatively hard (if at all possible) to evaluate. Here we take the opposite view on the problem and show that the bottleneck distance is in fact good enough {\em locally}, in the sense that it is able to discriminate a Reeb graph from any other Reeb graph in a small enough neighborhood, as efficiently as the other metrics do. This suggests considering the {\em intrinsic metrics} induced by these distances, which turn out to be all {\em globally} equivalent. This novel viewpoint on the study of Reeb graphs has a potential impact on applications, where one may not only be interested in discriminating between data but also in interpolating between them.},

Each such correspondence generates isometric embeddings of these spaces into a compact metric space such that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the initial spaces is equal to the Hausdorff distance between their images. Also, the optimal correspondences could be used for constructing the shortest curves in the Gromov-Hausdorff space in exactly the same way as it was done by Alexander Ivanov, Nadezhda Nikolaeva, and Alexey Tuzhilin in arXiv:1504.03830, where it is proved that the Gromov-Hausdorff space is geodesic. Notice that all proofs in the present paper are elementary and use no more than the idea of compactness.},

We show that the Mapper is an optimal estimator of the Reeb graph, which gives, as a byproduct, a method to automatically tune its parameters and compute confidence regions on its topological features, such as its loops and flares. This allows to circumvent the issue of testing a large grid of parameters and keeping the most stable ones in the brute-force setting, which is widely used in visualization, clustering and feature selection with the Mapper.},

	abstract = {Given a continuous function $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ and a cover $\mathcal{I}$ of its image by intervals, the Mapper is the nerve of a refinement of the pullback cover $f^{-1}(\mathcal{I})$. Despite its success in applications, little is known about the structure and stability of this construction from a theoretical point of view. As a pixelized version of the Reeb graph of $f$, it is expected to capture a subset of its features (branches, holes), depending on how the interval cover is positioned with respect to the critical values of the function. Its stability should also depend on this positioning. We propose a theoretical framework that relates the structure of the Mapper to the one of the Reeb graph, making it possible to predict which features will be present and which will be absent in the Mapper given the function and the cover, and for each feature, to quantify its degree of (in-)stability. Using this framework, we can derive guarantees on the structure of the Mapper, on its stability, and on its convergence to the Reeb graph as the granularity of the cover $\mathcal{I}$ goes to zero.},

Each source provides an additional perspective on the phenomenon of interest, but also comes with specific limitations, e.g. regarding accuracy, spatial and temporal availability. Effectively combining and analyzing such multimodal and partially incomplete data of limited accuracy in an integrated way is challenging. In this work, we outline an approach for an integrated analysis and visualization of the atmospheric impact of volcano eruptions. The data sets comprise observation and imaging data from satellites as well as results from numerical particle simulations. To analyze the clouds from the volcano eruption in the spatiotemporal domain we apply topological methods. Extremal structures reveal structures in the data that support clustering and comparison. We further discuss the robustness of those methods with respect to different properties of the data and different parameter setups. Finally we outline open challenges for the effective integrated visualization using topological methods.},

@article{Jeitziner2017,
	abstract = {There is a growing need for unbiased clustering methods, ideally automated. We have developed a topology-based analysis tool called Two-Tier Mapper (TTMap) to detect subgroups in global gene expression datasets and identify their distinguishing features. First, TTMap discerns and adjusts for highly variable features in the control group and identifies outliers. Second, the deviation of each test sample from the control group in a high-dimensional space is computed and the test samples are clustered in a global and local network using a new topological algorithm based on Mapper. Validation of TTMap on both synthetic and biological datasets shows that it outperforms current clustering methods in sensitivity and stability; clustering is not affected by removal of samples from the control group, choice of normalization nor subselection of data. There is no user induced bias because all parameters are data-driven. Datasets can readily be combined into one analysis. TTMap reveals hitherto undetected gene expression changes in mouse mammary glands related to hormonal changes during the estrous cycle. This illustrates the ability to extract information from highly variable biological samples and its potential for personalized medicine.},

	abstract = {Simulations and measurements often result in scalar fields with uncertainty due to errors or output sensitivity estimates. Meth- ods for analyzing topological features of such fields usually are not capable of handling all aspects of the data. They either are not deterministic due to using Monte Carlo approaches, approximate the data with confidence intervals, or miss out on incorporating important properties, such as correlation. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of critical points of Gaussian- distributed scalar fields. We introduce methods to deterministically extract critical points, approximate their probability with high precision, and even capture relations between them resulting in an abstract graph representation. Unlike many other methods, we incorporate all information contained in the data including global correlation. Our work therefore is a first step towards a reliable and complete description of topological features of Gaussian-distributed scalar fields.},

	abstract = {Sets of multiple scalar fields can be used to model different types of varying data, such as uncertainty in measurements and simulations or time-dependent behavior of scalar quantities. Many structural properties of such fields can be explained by de- pendencies between different points in the scalar field. Although these dependencies can be of arbitrary complexity, correlation, i.e., the linear dependency, already provides significant structural information. Existing methods for correlation analysis are usually limited to positive correlation, handle only local dependencies, or use combinatorial approximations to this continuous problem. We present a new approach for computing and visualizing correlated regions in sets of 2-dimensional scalar fields. This work consists of three main parts: (i) An algorithm for hierarchical correlation clustering resulting in a dendrogram, (ii) adaption of topological landscapes for dendrogram visualization, and (iii) an optional extension of our clustering and visualization to handle negative correlation values. All steps are designed to incorporate the special properties of correlation consistently. The results are visualized in two linked views, one showing the cluster hierarchy as 2D landscape and the other one providing spatial context in the scalar field's domain. Different color and texturing schemes coupled with interactive selection support an exploratory data analysis.},

The problem of computing similarity measures using scalar topology has been studied extensively and proven useful in shape and data matching. Even though multi-field (or multivariate) topology-based techniques reveal richer topological features, research on computing similarity measures using multi-field topology is still in its infancy. In the current paper, we propose a novel similarity measure between two piecewise-linear multi-fields based on their multi-resolution Reeb spaces - a newly developed data-structure that captures the topology of a multi-field. Overall, our method consists of two steps: (i) building a multi-resolution Reeb space corresponding to each of the multi-fields and (ii) proposing a similarity measure for a list of matching pairs (of nodes), obtained by comparing the multi-resolution Reeb spaces. We demonstrate an application of the proposed similarity measure by detecting the nuclear scission point in a time-varying multi-field data from computational physics},

	Abstract = {We present a new technique called ``t-SNE'' that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

	abstract = {Scalar functions defined on a topological space {\OE}{\copyright} are at the core of many ap- plications such as shape matching, visualization and physical simulations. Topo- logical persistence is an approach to characterizing these functions. It measures how long topological structures in the sub-level sets {x ‚{\`a}{\`a} {\OE}{\copyright} : f(x) ‚{\^a}{\S} c} persist as c changes. Recently it was shown that the critical values defining a topological structure with relatively large persistence remain almost unaffected by small per- turbations. This result suggests that topological persistence is a good measure for matching and comparing scalar functions. We extend these results to critical points in the domain by redefining persistence and critical points and replacing sub-level sets{x‚{\`a}{\`a}{\OE}{\copyright}:f(x)‚{\^a}{\S}c}withintervalsets{x‚{\`a}{\`a}{\OE}{\copyright}:a‚{\^a}{\S}f(x)<b}. With these modifications we establish a stability result for critical points. This result is strengthened for maxima that can be used for matching two scalar functions.},

Topological analysis of multifields is an approaches to find meaningful, intrinsic structures in complex data. Methods introduced in previous years were usually evaluated separately or rather informally. However, to aid the decision which method is best suited for a particular kind of data, it is important to compare and put them into context with each other. Using results from optimization mathematics, this paper finds subset and equivalence relations between Jacobi Sets and Pareto Sets and indicates even further relations to Morse decomposition. This is a first step towards the creation of new analysis tools for multifield topology and of new insight about how the topological approaches are connected with each other.},

Correct assignments are likely to establish links among each other and thus form a strongly connected cluster. Incorrect correspondences establish links with the other correspondences only accidentally, so they are unlikely to belong to strongly connected clusters. We recover the correct assignments based on how strongly they belong to the main cluster of M, by using the principal eigenvec- tor of M and imposing the mapping constraints required by the overall correspondence mapping (one-to-one or one-to- many). The experimental evaluation shows that our method is robust to outliers, accurate in terms of matching rate, while being much faster than existing methods.},

Here we use Topological Data Analysis to reveal the overall organization of whole-brain activity maps at a single-participant level---as an interactive representation---without arbitrarily collapsing data in space or time. Using existing multitask fMRI datasets, with the known ground truth about the timing of transitions from one task-block to next, our approach tracks both within- and between-task transitions at a much faster time scale (~4--9 s) than before. The individual differences in the revealed dynamical organization predict task performance.

In this paper, we present a novel approach for the interactive comparison of scalar fields using isosurfaces, and its application to fluid flow datasets. Features in two scalar fields are defined by largest contour segmentation after topological simplification. These features are matched using a volumetric similarity measure based on spatial overlap of individual features. The relationships defined by this similarity measure are ranked and presented in a thumbnail gallery of feature pairs and a graph representation showing all relationships between individual contours. Additionally, linked views of the contour trees are provided to ease navigation. The main render view shows the selected features overlapping each other. Thus, by displaying individual features and their relationships in a structured fashion, we enable exploratory visualization of correlations between similar structures in two scalar fields. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a number of complex fluid flow datasets, where the emphasis is put on the comparison of vortex related scalar quantities.},

The explicit extraction of vortex merge graphs enables the application of statistical tools to investigate the vortex core lines themselves. The analysis tool provides common plots as scatter plots and parallel coordinates to explore the correlation of different quantities. An abstract representation of the vortex merge graph highlights birth, death and merges of vortices. Interactive picking of substructures supports a closer insepection of single vortices and their evolution. A further step inte- grates the regions of influence into the statistical analysis. Minima, maxima, median, mean and other percentiles of the measures along the vortex merge graph and its regions are visualized. The usability of the framework is demonstrated using a simulated flow data set of a mixing layer and a jet.

In course of the simulations the solutions form structures with increased salt concentration value, called viscous fingers. These structures are of primary interest to domain scientists since it is not deterministic when and where viscous fingers appear and how they evolve. To explore the aleatoric uncertainty embedded in the simulations we analyze an ensemble of simulation runs which differ due to stochastic effects. To detect and track the viscous fingers we derive a voxel volume for each simulation where fingers are identified as subvolumes that satisfy geometrical and topological constraints. Properties and the evolution of fingers are illustrated through tracking graphs that visualize when fingers form, dissolve, merge, and split. We provide multiple linked views to compare, browse, and analyze the ensemble in real-time.},

A recent method models event detection as a maximum-weight independent set problem on a graph representation of all possible explanations [35]. However, optimally solving this problem is NP-hard in the general case. Following the approach by Schnorr et al., we propose a new algorithm for event detection. Our algorithm exploits the modelspecific structure of the independent set problem. Specifically, we show how to traverse potential explanations in such a way that a greedy assignment provides reliably good results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic and simulation data sets, the former of which include ground-truth tracking information which enable a quantitative evaluation. Our results are within 1% of the theoretical optimum and comparable to an approximate solution provided by a state-of-the-art optimization package.

Facilitating easy-to-use, interactive exploration and analysis of cyclones can serve as a useful tool to support domain scientists in their research. We present a framework for tracking and visualizing multi- center cyclones, which takes into account cyclones which merge and split over their lifetime. All parts of our framework allow interaction by domain scientists: the algorithm for computing the tracking graph, selections of individual cyclone tracks and the parameters used for visualizing the results. A cyclonic region defines the spread and boundary of a cyclone and over time, the pressure within the region changes. Therefore, a cyclone cannot be represented by an iso-surface in three dimensions and instead, we segment a volume by region growing from the track of the cyclone and finally, extracting a surface around the cyclonic region. We offer multiple criteria for this algorithm, allowing the domain scientist to explore and visually analyze the data. Furthermore, we enable an easy overview of the cyclone time series by mapping time to the third dimension.},

@article{Kasten2011a,
	Abstract = {Acceleration is a fundamental quantity of flow fields that captures
	Galilean invariant properties of particle motion. Consid- ering the
	magnitude of this field, minima represent characteristic structures
	of the flow that can be classified as saddle- or vortex-like. We
	made the interesting observation that vortex-like minima are enclosed
	by particularly pronounced ridges. This makes it possible to define
	boundaries of vortex regions in a parameter-free way. Utilizing scalar
	field topology, a robust algorithm can be designed to extract such
	boundaries. They can be arbitrarily shaped. An efficient tracking
	algorithm allows us to display the temporal evolution of vortices.
	Various vortex models are used to evaluate the method. We apply our
	method to two-dimensional model systems from computational fluid
	dynamics and compare the results to those arising from existing definitions.},

A graph representing the topology changes of time-varying isosurfaces is constructed in real-time for any selected isovalue using the precomputed correspondence information. Quantitative properties, such as surface area and volume of contour components, are computed and labeled on the graph. This topology change graph helps users to detect significant topological and geometric changes in time-varying isosurfaces. The graph is also used as an interactive user interface to segment, track, and visualize the evolution of any selected contour components over time},

@article{Doraiswamy2013a,
	abstract = {We describe a framework to explore and visualize the movement of cloud
	systems. Using techniques from computational topology and computer
	vision, our framework allows the user to study this movement at various
	scales in space and time. Such movements could have large temporal
	and spatial scales such as the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), which
	has a spatial scale ranging from 1000 km to 10000 km and time of
	oscillation of around 40 days. Embedded within these larger scale
	oscillations are a hierarchy of cloud clusters which could have smaller
	spatial and temporal scales such as the Nakazawa cloud clusters.
	These smaller cloud clusters, while being part of the equatorial
	MJO, sometimes move at speeds different from the larger scale and
	in a direction opposite to that of the MJO envelope. Hitherto, one
	could only speculate about such movements by selectively analysing
	data and a priori knowledge of such systems. Our framework automatically
	delineates such cloud clusters and does not depend on the prior experience
	of the user to define cloud clusters. Analysis using our framework
	also shows that most tropical systems such as cyclones also contain
	multi-scale interactions between clouds and cloud systems. We show
	the effectiveness of our framework to track organized cloud system
	during one such rainfall event which happened at Mumbai, India in
	July 2005 and for cyclone Aila which occurred in Bay of Bengal during
	May 2009},

@article{WangJ2018,
	abstract = {Over the last decade, ensemble visualization has witnessed a significant development due to the wide availability of ensemble data, and the increasing visualization needs from a variety of disciplines. From the data analysis point of view, it can be observed that many ensemble visualization works focus on the same facet of ensemble data, use similar data aggregation or uncertainty modeling methods. However, the lack of reflections on those essential commonalities and a systematic overview of those works prevents visualization researchers from effectively identifying new or unsolved problems and planning for further developments. In this paper, we take a holistic perspective and provide a survey of ensemble visualization. Specifically, we study ensemble visualization works in the recent decade, and categorize them from two perspectives: (1) their proposed visualization techniques; and (2) their involved analytic tasks. For the first perspective, we focus on elaborating how conventional visualization techniques (e.g., surface, volume visualization techniques) have been adopted to ensemble data; for the second perspective, we emphasize how analytic tasks (e.g., comparison, clustering) have been performed differently for ensemble data. From the study of ensemble visualization literature, we have also identified several research trends, as well as some future research opportunities.},

A dual contour tree structure is constructed from the contour tree of a volume by dividing its functional range into segments such that the connected contour tree edges within a segment become a node in the dual tree. Each node of the dual contour tree corresponds to a connected sub-volume bounded by contours within a certain range segment. Attributes such as functional range, volume, and Betti number of bounding contours are further computed for each node of the dual contour tree. A similarity metric between two volumes is computed by matching the multi-resolution dual contour trees and corresponding attributes. When applied to biomolecular structures and associated properties such as electrostatic potentials, this al-gorithm shows good performance separating proteins into different classes.},
